## üåü Overview

**JARVIS** (Just A Rather Very Intelligent System) is a sophisticated Python-based voice-activated personal assistant designed to streamline your daily computing tasks. Inspired by the AI assistant from Iron Man, this project leverages cutting-edge speech recognition and text-to-speech technologies to provide an intuitive, hands-free interaction experience.

The assistant can perform a wide range of tasks including web searches, application launching, system control, and information retrieval‚Äîall through simple voice commands. Whether you need to quickly search Wikipedia, play your favorite music, or control your system, JARVIS is here to help.

"Open YouTube"
"Open Google"
"Open Instagram"
"Open Stack Overflow"
"Open GitHub"
```

### System Operations
```
"What time is it?"
"Tell me the time"
"What's today's date?"
"Shutdown system"
"Restart computer"
"Put the system to sleep"
```

### Code Organization

- **`speak(text)`**: Converts text to speech output
- **`wishme()`**: Greets user based on time of day
- **`takecommand()`**: Captures and processes voice input
- **`main()`**: Core logic and command routing

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Customizing Voice Properties

Modify the following in `jarvis_2.0.py`:

```python
engine = pyttsx3.init()
voices = engine.getProperty('voices')
engine.setProperty('voice', voices[1].id)  # Change index for different voice
engine.setProperty('rate', 150)  # Adjust speech rate
```

### Adding Custom Commands

Extend the command logic in the main function:

```python
elif 'your custom command' in query:
    # Your custom action here
    speak("Executing custom command")
```

### Setting Music Directory

```python
music_path = "YOUR_MUSIC_DIRECTORY_PATH"
```
